* Ideas for improvement
** Usability

*** Preview system

**** Issues
    - only two preview styles available by default
    - not possible to add more styles
    - not clear how to modify the existing styles
    - the preference pane tab for "Entry preview" is unintuitive and
      unusable
    - search does not respect the html structure of preview

**** Steps
   - Create more preview styles: more citation styles
   - Selecting multiple rows in the main table should create show a
     preview of all the selected entries.
